The data-2013-01-01-2013-01-22.log file contains up-to-date sanitized apache logs.

This log data mimics what is fed to the census database on the server side on canonical's servers.
This log contains machine check-ins from January 1, 2013 through January 22, 2013. 

To create a test database with the census tool using this data, please run the following command:

./census -d <your-database>.db -l data-2013-01-01-2013-01-22.log 

..where <your-database> is whichever name you want to give to your sample database.

You can then generate various reports using such commands as:

./census -d <your-database>.db --text

...to get a text dump of the database. 

More options can be found by running "./census --help".
