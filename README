Endless OS "Phone Home"
-----------------------

This is based off https://launchpad.net/canonical-poke imported from bzr to git
on Sat 9th July 2016. The "census" (simple sqlite stats processing) and
"sanitize" (log cleanup / anonymisation) have been reinstated from the bzr
history and separate bzr branch.

The intention is to re-use the anonymous counting approach set out in
http://theravingrick.blogspot.co.uk/2010/08/can-we-count-users-without-uniquely.html
so that Endless can dermine the number of active systems without sending any
trackable information, but in the immediate term we are implementing a one-off
"activate" request so we can tell how many systems have been turned on. This
request does include the machine serial number, but this is not personally
identifiable information, and is only ever sent once so cannot be used for any
ongoing tracking.
